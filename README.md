# Swords-of-Solace
An early version of an RPG I was planning on making for a while but my CS NEA got in the way.


CREDITS:

Games that inspired me:

Undertale

Deltarune

Soul Nomad and the World Eaters

Dayshift at Freddy's (FNAF Fangame)


Also, if it wasn't obvious already, this is a Deltarune fangame. If you haven't played that, I HIGHLY recommend you to, as chapter 1 & 2 are completely free and they are amazing games. Due to this, I have used many (editted) assets from that game, though the rest are my own assets. The assets taken from Deltarune are mainly either for the UI (to keep it consistent with Deltarune's style) or environment ones e.g. chests or trees (since I suck at most pixel art).
